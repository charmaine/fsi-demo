# Frontend Design Skill

This skill provides guidance for creating distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Key Purpose

Generate creative, polished web components, pages, and applications with high design quality and exceptional aesthetic attention.

## Design Thinking Process

Before coding, establish a **BOLD aesthetic direction** by considering:

1. **Purpose** - What problem does the interface solve? Who uses it?
2. **Tone** - Pick an extreme aesthetic direction:
   - Brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic
   - Organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like
   - Editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric
   - Soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
3. **Constraints** - Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
4. **Differentiation** - What makes it unforgettable?

**Critical principle**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Both bold maximalism and refined minimalism work—intentionality matters, not intensity.

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography

- Choose **beautiful, unique, distinctive fonts** over generic defaults
- Avoid Arial, Inter, Roboto, system fonts
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font

### Color & Theme

- Commit to a **cohesive aesthetic**
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes

### Motion

- Use animations for high-impact moments
- CSS-only solutions for HTML; Motion library for React
- Focus on orchestrated page loads with staggered reveals
- Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

### Spatial Composition

- Embrace unexpected layouts, asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow
- Include grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Backgrounds & Visual Details

- Create atmosphere and depth
- Add textures matching the aesthetic (gradient meshes, noise, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, grain overlays)

## What to Avoid

- Generic AI-generated aesthetics
- Overused font families
- Cliched color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character

## Implementation Philosophy

- **Production-grade and functional** code
- **Visually striking and memorable** designs
- **Cohesive** with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- **Meticulously refined** in every detail
- Match complexity to vision: maximalist designs need elaborate code; minimalist designs need precision and restraint

**Core principle**: Show extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back—commit fully to a distinctive vision.
